sortedset
==========

.. currentmodule:: blist

.. class:: sortedset(iterable=(), key=None)

   A :class:`sortedset` provides the same methods as a :class:`set`.
   Additionally, a :class:`sortedset:` maintains its items in sorted
   order, allowing the :class:`sortedset` to be indexed.

   An optional *iterable* provides an initial series of items to
   populate the :class:`sortedset`.

   *key* specifies a function of one argument that is used to extract
   a comparison key from each set element: ``key=str.lower``. The
   default value is ``None`` (compare the elements directly).  The
   *key* function must always return the same key for an item or the
   results are unpredictable.

   Unlike a :class:`set`, a :class:`sortedset` does not require items
   to be hashable.

   .. method:: x in S

      Returns True if and only if *x* is an element in the set.

      Requires |theta(log**2 n)| total operations or |theta(log n)|
      comparisons.

      :rtype: :class:`bool`

   .. _sortedset.delitem:
   .. method:: del S[i]

      Removes the element located at index *i* from the set.

      Requires |theta(log n)| operations and no comparisons.

   .. method:: del S[i:j]

      Removes the elements from *i* to *j* from the set.

      Requires |theta(log n)| operations and no comparisons.

   .. method:: S < S2

      Test whether the set is a proper subset of *S2*, that is, ``S <= S2
      and S != other``.

      In the worst case, requires |theta(n)| operations multiplied by
      the cost of *S2*'s `in` operation.

      :rtype: :class:`bool`

   .. method:: S > S2

      Test whether the set is a proper superset of *S2*, that is, ``S
      >= S2 and S != S2``.

      In the worst case, requires |theta(m log**2 n)| operations or
      |theta(m log n)| comparisons, where *m* is the size of *S2* and
      *n* is the size of *S*.

      :rtype: :class:`bool`

   .. method:: S[i]

      Returns the element at position *i*.

      Requires |theta(log n)| operations in the worst case but only
      |theta(1)| operations if the set's size has not been changed
      recently.  Requires no comparisons in any case.

      :rtype: item

   .. method:: S[i:j]

      Returns a new sortedset containing the elements from *i* to *j*.

      Requires |theta(log n)| operations and no comparisons.

      :rtype: :class:`sortedset`

   .. method:: S *= k

      Increase the length of the set by a factor of *k*, by inserting
      *k-1* additional shallow copies of each item in the set.

      Requires |theta(n log(k + n))| operations and no comparisons.

   .. method:: iter(S)

      Creates an iterator over the set.

      Requires |theta(log n)| operations to create the iterator.  Each
      element from the iterator requires |theta(1)| operations to
      retrieve, or |theta(n)| operations to iterate over the entire
      set.

      :rtype: iterator

   .. method:: len(S)

      Returns the number of elements in the set.

      Requires |theta(1)| operations.

      :rtype: :class:`int`

   .. method:: S * k or k * S

      Returns a new sorted set containing *k* shallow copies of each
      item in S.

      Requires |theta(n log(k + n))| operations and no comparisons.

      :rtype: :class:`sortedset`

   .. method:: reversed(S)

      Creates an iterator to traverse the set in reverse.

      Requires |theta(log n)| operations to create the iterator.  Each
      element from the iterator requires |theta(1)| operations to
      retrieve, or |theta(n)| operations to iterate over the entire
      set.  Requires no comparisons in any case.

      :rtype: iterator

   .. _sortedset.add:
   .. method:: S.add(value)

      Add the element *value* to the set.

      Requires |theta(log**2 n)| total operations or |theta(log n)|
      comparisons.

   .. _sortedlist.bisect_left:
   .. method:: L.bisect_left(value)

      Similarly to the ``bisect`` module in the standard library, this
      returns an appropriate index to insert *value* in *L*. If *value* is
      already present in *L*, the insertion point will be before (to the
      left of) any existing entries.

      Requires |theta(log**2 n)| total operations or |theta(log n)|
      comparisons.

   .. method:: L.bisect(value)

      Same as :ref:`bisect_left <sortedlist.bisect_right>`.

   .. method:: L.bisect_right(value)

      Same thing as :ref:`bisect_left <sortedlist.bisect_left>`, but if
      *value* is already present in *L*, the insertion point will be after
      (to the right of) any existing entries.

   .. method:: S.clear()

      Remove all elements from the set.

      worst case.

      :rtype: :class:`int`

   .. method:: S.difference(S2, ...)
               S - S2 - ...

      Return a new set with elements in the set that are not in the others.

      In the worst case, requires |theta(m log**2(n + m))| operations
      and |theta(m log(n + m))| comparisons, where *m* is the combined
      size of all the other sets and *n* is the size of *S*.

      :rtype: :class:`sortedset`

   .. method:: S.difference_update(S2, ...)
               S -= S2 | ...

      Update the set, removing elements found in keeping only elements
      found in any of the others.

      In the worst case, requires |theta(m log**2(n + m))| operations
      and |theta(m log(n + m))| comparisons, where *m* is the combined
      size of all the other sets and *n* is the initial size of *S*.

   .. _sortedset.discard:
   .. method:: S.discard(value)

      Removes the first occurrence of *value*.  If *value* is not a
      member, does nothing.

      In the worst case, requires |theta(log**2 n)| operations and
      |theta(log n)| comparisons.

   .. method:: S.index(value, [start, [stop]])

      Returns the smallest *k* such that :math:`S[k] == x` and
      :math:`i <= k < j`.  Raises ValueError if *value* is not
      present.  *stop* defaults to the end of the set.  *start*
      defaults to the beginning.  Negative indexes are supported, as
      for slice indices.

      In the worst case, requires |theta(stop-start)| operations and
      |theta(stop-start)| comparisons.

      :rtype: :class:`int`

   .. method:: S.intersection(S2, ...)
               S & S2 & ...

      Return a new set with elements common to the set and all others.

      In the worst case, requires |theta(m log**2(n + m))| operations

      size of all the other sets and *n* is the initial size of *S*.

   .. method:: S.isdisjoint(S2)

      Return True if the set has no elements in common with *S2*.

   .. method:: S.issubset(S2)
               S <= S2

      Test whether every element in the set is in *S2*

      Update the set, keeping only elements found in either set, but
      not in both.

      *S2* and *n* is the initial size of *S*.

   .. method:: S.pop([index])

      Removes and return item at index (default last).  Raises
      IndexError if set is empty or index is out of range.  Negative
      indexes are supported, as for slice indices.

      others.  The new sortedset will be sorted according to the key
      of the leftmost set.

      Requires |theta(m log**2(n + m))| operations or |theta(m log(n +
      m))| comparisons, where *m* is the total size of the other sets
      and *n* is the size of *S*.

      :rtype: :class:`sortedset`

   .. method:: S.update(S2, ...)
               S |= S2 | ...

      In the worst case, requires |theta(m log**2(n + m))| operations
      and |theta(m log(n + m))| comparisons, where *m* is the combined
      size of all the other sets and *n* is the initial size of *S*.
